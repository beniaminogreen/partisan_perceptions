# Replication Materials Repository

Welcome to the repository of replication materials.  Please follow the steps
below if you are interested in re-running the code used to generate the paper
using Docker, which manages all necessary dependencies for you. Alternatively,
you can use make to recomplie a version of the analysis provided you have
all of the dependencies installed.

Analysis logs and system info can be found in the .Rout files. The analysis is
reported in the report.pdf file, which is generated by running the Docker
container.

## Replication With Docker
Using either git in the command line, or the download button above, clone this repository and navigate into it.

Then, depending on your system, run the following commands.

### Using Linux / Mac / Windows Power Shell:
```
docker build -t replication .
docker run --rm -v ${PWD}:/opt/report replication
```
### Using Windows Command Line:
```
docker build -t replication .
docker run --rm -v  %cd%:/opt/report replication
```
The first command could take around 5 minutes as installing the necessary R packages is slow.
The next command should run in under 2 minutes.
Once both have run, you should find a newly-generated copy of the report, ```report.pdf``` in the root directory.

Hope you enjoy!
